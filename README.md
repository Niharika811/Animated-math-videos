# ðŸ§  AI Internship Task â€“ Animated Math Equation Videos

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task is to generate short educational animations of basic math equations using frame-by-frame logic. Each video visually and clearly shows how a math equation is formed and solved step by step.

---

## ðŸŽ¥ Video Samples
Each video is around 2â€“5 seconds long, showing animations like:

- **Addition:** 1 + 2 = 3  
- **Subtraction:** 9 - 4 = 5  
- **Multiplication:** 3 Ã— 3 = 9

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Python**
- **MoviePy** â€“ for creating and stitching frames into videos
- **Pillow (PIL)** â€“ for drawing frames
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** â€“ for optional voiceover
